We can improve our bandit algorithms by refining how we balance exploration and exploitation.
For example, we can adjust the exploration rate dynamically based on the performance of each arm,
allowing for more aggressive exploration early on and gradual commitment as our confidence grows.
We can also integrate Bayesian updating to better quantify uncertainty, which helps in selecting the most promising
arms more accurately. By running multiple experiments under different conditions, we can fine-tune our
hyperparameters to reduce regret and maximize cumulative rewards. This adaptive and data-driven approach
makes our algorithms more robust and efficient in diverse and changing environments.
